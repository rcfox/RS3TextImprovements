# Romancing SaGa 3 Text Improvements

## How To Install

1. Download the latest [RS3TextImprovements.zip](https://github.com/rcfox/RS3TextImprovements/releases/latest/download/RS3TextImprovements.zip)
    * Older versions might also be available on the [Releases](https://github.com/rcfox/RS3TextImprovements/releases) page.
2. Get [UnityModManager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21/)(UMM).
    * If you already have it, make sure to upgrade to at least version **0.23.4b**
3. Run UMM, set the game to "Romancing SaGa 3", choose the directory it's installed to, then click the "Install" button.
    * If you're using Steam, the directory will probably be `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\RomancingSaGa3`
4. In the Mods tab of UMM, either drop the zip file into the bottom of the window, or click the "Install Mod" button to find the zip file.
5. If everything worked correctly, you should be greeted by a "Mod Manager" window when the game starts up.
    * You can disable this popup from happening at startup from the Mod Manager's settings tab.
    * You can open/close the Mod Manager with Ctrl+F10
    
**Note**: If you installed an older version of this mod by copying an `Assembly-CSharp.dll` file, make sure to revert back to the original DLL. If you use Steam, doing a "Verify the integrity of game files" will redownload the original version.
